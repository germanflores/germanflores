My name is Germ√°n Flores I bring a bias towards action, this manifests itself in my attitude to look for angles instead of angels to solve problems. I have helped technology teams implement effective ways of working using agile principles and frameworks. I'm also an observant of team culture and relate to the nuances of "Culture Eats Strategy For Breakfast".

I work at IMG Academy as Sr. Director of Portfolio Management/Project Management Office, you can [read about what I bring to the team on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/germanflores).
