Every organization has their own norms and levels or organization when using slack. Here are a few norms to help your organization.

## Norms on this Slack

Publish your slack norms (document similar to this post), in a canvas document in a main channel.

* Before using `@here` know how many people are in the channel, see if there's a team/audience specific slack handle first instead of letting everyone
* Unfurled links take up a lot space, consider removing the unfurl while retaining the link
* Use the Slack channel naming conventions
* Make channels public, unless they need to be private
* Mind your slack, every quarter e.g., archive, leave channels

## Slack Map
The slack map is meant to make people joining your slack become aware faster. Some areas that you could list:

* Teams
* Incident Response
* Admin/Meetings/Process
* Deploys & Alerts
* Hobby/Social

## Naming Slack Channels

* Use `proj-` for project channels
* Use `temp-` for ephemeral conversations
* Use `rdm-` for non-work fun channels
* Use `team-teamname` team public channels
* Use `team-teamname-pvt-` for team private channels
* * Use `incident-dd-mm-yyyy-incidentname-` for technology incidents
* Use `-` dashes instead of `_` underscores to name channels

Hat tip to Brett Bernstein for the additional naming conventions
