**Cycling in 2026. The Best Is Yet To Come**

![alt](/images/2026-coast-to-coast.jpeg)

In 2026 I'm going to try to bicycle from Chicago to New York city.

The long term build up is:
* Around Lake Michigan, 2025
* Chicago to NYC (east coast), 2026
* Chicago to California (west coast), 2027
* Coast to coast, 2028
