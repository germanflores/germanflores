2025 was good cycling year. The hardest things I did where the ones that rewarded me the most.

**Cycling Across Florida**

What a rough couple of days. First day Titusville (east coast of Florida) to Wiscon Florida (almost to the west coast of Florida), 149.5 miles, 12hrs of riding in the rain, 17 hr day.

Day two: Wiscon to Bradenton Florida, 114 miles, 9 hrs of riding. Tampa was the unsafest street riding I've done in my life. Done with Florida riding.

**Cycling Around Lake Michigan**

Started in Evanston IL, went around lake Michigan, ended in Evanston IL in ten days, about ~1060 miles. Oof. Acclimation came on day 7, the body said, "okay, this is the new normal". Carrying dry-soak meals enabled me to eat nutritious food on my on schedule. Dry-soak meals, this is the way.


**Fastest Time Evanston IL → Port Washington WI**

I did my fastest time on this ride. I've been doing this ride for a couple of decades, the fitness I built this year enabled me to go faster.

Lastly, Ride With GPS is a fantastic service for planning routes, worth every penny.
