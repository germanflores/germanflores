Your co-worker, friend, partner, person other random slack you are on: posts a link to an article, the title is enticing enough BUT you don’t want to commit to reading xyz long article, the ads on the page, etc.

If you use kagi.com (paid search), you can use their summarizer service. Pass it a public URL (on mac/ios via tear sheet shortcut) and it will summarize the contents of any accessible url, it can also summarize youtube videos if there’s a transcript available.
